## **What Is Rock Paper Scissors?**

You may have came across rock paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for the dinner or who gets the first choice of players for a team.

If you’re unfamiliar with it, rock paper scissors is a [hand game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_game) for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

- **Rock** smashes scissors.
- **Paper** covers rock.
- **Scissors** cut paper.

Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might get to work in Python code.

### **Play a Single Game of Rock Paper Scissors in Python**

Using the description and rules above, you can make a game of rock paper scissors. Before you deep dive into it's development, you’re going to need to import the module you’ll use it to simulate the computer’s choices of rock, paper or scissor:

`import random`

Awesome! Now you’re able to use the different tools inside `random` to randomize the computer’s actions in the game. Now what? Since your users will also need to be able to choose their actions, the first logical thing you need is a way to take in user input.

### **Take User Input**

Taking input from the user is pretty straightforward in Python. The goal here is to ask the user what they would like to choose as an action and then assign that choice to a variable:

`user_input = input("Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")`

This will prompt the user to enter a selection and save it to a variable for later use. Now that the user has selected an action, the computer needs to decide what to do.

### **Make the Computer Choose**

A competitive game of rock paper scissors involves strategy. Rather than trying to develop a ML model for that, though, you can save yourself some time by having the computer select a random action. Random choices are a great way to have the computer choose a value.

You can use **`random.choice()`** to have the computer randomly select between the actions:

```python
actions = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
computer_action = random.choice(actions)
```

This allows a random element to be selected from the list. You can also print the choices that the user and the computer made:

```python
print(f"You chose {user_input}, computer chose {computer_action}.")
```

Printing the user and computer actions can be helpful to the user, and it can also help you debug later on in case something isn’t quite right with the outcome.

### **Determine a Winner**

Now that both players have made their choice, you just need a way to decide who wins. Using an `if` … `elif` … `else` block, you can compare players’ choices and determine a winner:

```python
if user_action == computer_action:
    print(f"Both players selected {user_action}. It's a tie!")
elif user_action == "rock":
    if computer_action == "scissors":
        print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
    else:
        print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
elif user_action == "paper":
    if computer_action == "rock":
        print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
    else:
        print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
elif user_action == "scissors":
    if computer_action == "paper":
        print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
    else:
        print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")
```

By comparing the tie condition first, you get rid of quite a few cases. If you didn’t do that, then you’d need to check each possible action for `user_action` and compare it against each possible action for `computer_action`. By checking the tie condition first, you’re able to know what the computer chose with only two conditional checks of `computer_action`.

And that’s it! All combined, your code should now look like this:

```python
import random

user_action = input("Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")
possible_actions = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
computer_action = random.choice(possible_actions)
print(f"\nYou chose {user_action}, computer chose {computer_action}.\n")

if user_action == computer_action:
    print(f"Both players selected {user_action}. It's a tie!")
elif user_action == "rock":
    if computer_action == "scissors":
        print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
    else:
        print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
elif user_action == "paper":
    if computer_action == "rock":
        print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
    else:
        print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
elif user_action == "scissors":
    if computer_action == "paper":
        print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
    else:
        print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")
```

You’ve now written code to take in user input, select a random action for the computer, and decide the winner! But this only lets you play one game before the program finishes running.

### **Play Several Games in a Row**

Although a single game of rock paper scissors is super fun, wouldn’t it be better if you could play several games in a row? **Loops** are a great way to create recurring events. In particular, you can use a while loop to play indefinitely:

```python
import random

while True:
    user_action = input("Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")
    possible_actions = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    computer_action = random.choice(possible_actions)
    print(f"\nYou chose {user_action}, computer chose {computer_action}.\n")

    if user_action == computer_action:
        print(f"Both players selected {user_action}. It's a tie!")
    elif user_action == "rock":
        if computer_action == "scissors":
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
        else:
            print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
    elif user_action == "paper":
        if computer_action == "rock":
            print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
        else:
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
    elif user_action == "scissors":
        if computer_action == "paper":
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
        else:
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")

    play_again = input("Play again? (y/n): ")
    if play_again.lower() != "y":
        break
```

Notice the highlighted lines above. It’s important to check if the user wants to play again and to `break` if they don’t. Without that check, the user would be forced to play until they terminated the console using `Ctrl+C` or a similar method.

The check for playing again is a check against the string `"y"`. But checking for something specific like this might make it harder for the user stop playing. What if the user types `"yes"` or `"no"`? String comparison is often tricky because you never know what the user might enter. They might do all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of the two.

Hmm. That’s not what you want. The user might not be too happy if they enter `"yes"` expecting to play again but are kicked from the game.

### **Describe an Action With enum.IntEnum**

Because string comparisons can cause problems like you saw above, it’s a good idea to avoid them whenever possible. One of the first things your program asks, however, is for the user to input a string! What if the user inputs `"Rock"` or `"rOck"` by mistake? Capitalization matters, so they won’t be equal:
```python
>>> print("rock" == "Rock")
False
```

Since capitalization matters, `"r"` and `"R"` aren’t equal. One possible solution would be to use [numbers](https://realpython.com/python-numbers/) instead. Assigning each action a number could save you some trouble:

```python
ROCK_ACTION = 0
PAPER_ACTION = 1
SCISSORS_ACTION = 2
```

This allows you to reference different actions by their assigned number. Integers don’t suffer the same comparison issues as strings, so this could work. Now you can have the user input a number and compare it directly against those values:

```python
user_input = input("Enter a choice (rock[0], paper[1], scissors[2]): ")
user_action = int(user_input)
if user_action == ROCK_ACTION:
    # Handle ROCK_ACTION
```

Because `input()` returns a string, you need to [convert the return value to an integer](https://realpython.com/convert-python-string-to-int/) using `int()`. Then you can compare the input to each of the actions above. This works well, but it might rely on you naming variables correctly in order to keep track of them. A better way is to use **`enum.IntEnum`** and define your own action class!

Using `enum.IntEnum` allows you to create attributes and assign them values similar to those shown above. This helps clean up your code by grouping actions into their own [namespaces](https://realpython.com/python-namespaces-scope/) and making the code more expressive:

```python
from enum import IntEnum

class Action(IntEnum):
    Rock = 0
    Paper = 1
    Scissors = 2
```

This creates a custom `Action` that you can use to reference the different types of actions you support. It works by assigning each attribute within it to a value you specify.

Comparisons are still straightforward, and now they have a helpful class name associated with them:

```python
>>> Action.Rock == Action.Rock
True
```

Because the member values are the same, the comparison is equal. The class names also make it more obvious that you want to compare two actions.

**Note:** To learn more about `enum`, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html).

You can even create an `Action` from an `int`:

```python
>>> Action.Rock == Action(0)
True
>>> Action(0)
<Action.Rock: 0>
```

`Action` looks at the value passed in and returns the appropriate `Action`. This is helpful because now you can take in the user input as an `int` and create an `Action` from it. No more worrying about spelling!

### **The Flow(chart) of Your Program**

Although rock paper scissors might seem uncomplicated, it’s important to carefully consider the steps involved in playing it so that you can be sure your program covers all possible scenarios. For any project, even small ones, it’s helpful to create a **flowchart** of the desired behavior and implement code around it. You could achieve a similar result using a bulleted list, but it’d be harder to capture things like loops and [conditional logic](https://realpython.com/python-conditional-statements/).

Flowcharts don’t have to be overly complicated or even use real code. Just describing the desired behavior ahead of time can help you fix problems before they happen!

Here’s a flowchart that describes a single game of rock paper scissors:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55938019/122668752-373f4800-d1d7-11eb-96dc-9c77ea58a1ae.png)

Each player selects an action and then a winner is determined. This flowchart is accurate for a single game as you’ve coded it, but it’s not necessarily accurate for real-life games. In real life, the players select their actions simultaneously rather than one at a time like the flowchart suggests.

In the coded version, however, this works because the player’s choice is hidden from the computer, and the computer’s choice is hidden from the player. The two players can make their choices at different times without affecting the fairness of the game.

Flowcharts help you catch possible mistakes early on and also let you see if you want to add more functionality. For example, here’s a flowchart that describes how to play games repeatedly until the user decides to stop:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55938019/122668756-43c3a080-d1d7-11eb-954e-007f521c2bf1.png)

Without writing code, you can see that the first flowchart doesn’t have a way to play again. This approach allows you to tackle issues like these before programming, which helps you create neater, more manageable code!

### **Split Your Code Into Functions**

Now that you’ve outlined the flow of your program using a flowchart, you can try to organize your code so that it more closely resembles the steps you’ve identified. One natural way to do this is to [create a function](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/) for each step in the flowchart. Functions are a great way to separate larger chunks of code into smaller, more manageable pieces.

You don’t necessarily need to create a function for the conditional check to play again, but you can if you’d like. You can start by importing `random` if you haven’t already and defining your `Action` class:

```python
import random
from enum import IntEnum

class Action(IntEnum):
    Rock = 0
    Paper = 1
    Scissors = 2
```

Hopefully this all looks familiar so far! Now here’s the code for `get_user_selection()`, which doesn’t take in any arguments and [returns](https://realpython.com/python-return-statement/) an `Action`:

```python
def get_user_selection():
    user_input = input("Enter a choice (rock[0], paper[1], scissors[2]): ")
    selection = int(user_input)
    action = Action(selection)
    return action
```

Notice how you take in the user input as an `int` and get back an `Action`. That long message for the user is a bit cumbersome, though. What would happen if you wanted to add more actions? You’d have to add even more text to the prompt.

Instead, you can use a list comprehension to generate a portion of the input:

```python
def get_user_selection():
    choices = [f"{action.name}[{action.value}]" for action in Action]
    choices_str = ", ".join(choices)
    selection = int(input(f"Enter a choice ({choices_str}): "))
    action = Action(selection)
    return action
```

Now you no longer need to worry about adding or removing actions in the future! Testing this out, you can see how the code prompts the user and returns an action associated with the user’s input value:

```python
>>> get_user_selection()
Enter a choice (rock[0], paper[1], scissors[2]): 0
<Action.Rock: 0>
```

Now you need a function for getting the computer’s action. Like `get_user_selection()`, this function should take no arguments and return an `Action`. Because the values for `Action` range from `0` to `2`, you’re going to want to generate a random number within that range. **`random.randint()`** can help with that.

`random.randint()` returns a random value between a specified minimum and maximum (inclusive). You can use `len()` to help figure out what the upper bound should be in your code:

```python
def get_computer_selection():
    selection = random.randint(0, len(Action) - 1)
    action = Action(selection)
    return action
```

Because the `Action` values start counting from `0`, and len() starts counting from `1`, it’s important to do `len(Action) - 1`.

When you test this, there won’t be a prompt. It will simply return the action associated with the random number:

```python
>>> get_computer_selection()
<Action.Scissors: 2>
```

Looking good! Next, you need a way to determine a winner. This function will take two arguments, the user’s action and the computer’s action. It doesn’t need to return anything since it’ll just display the result to the console:

```python
def determine_winner(user_action, computer_action):
    if user_action == computer_action:
        print(f"Both players selected {user_action.name}. It's a tie!")
    elif user_action == Action.Rock:
        if computer_action == Action.Scissors:
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You win!")
        else:
            print("Paper covers rock! You lose.")
    elif user_action == Action.Paper:
        if computer_action == Action.Rock:
            print("Paper covers rock! You win!")
        else:
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You lose.")
    elif user_action == Action.Scissors:
        if computer_action == Action.Paper:
            print("Scissors cuts paper! You win!")
        else:
            print("Rock smashes scissors! You lose.")
```

This is pretty similar to the first comparison you used to determine a winner. Now you can just directly compare `Action` types without worrying about those pesky strings!

You can even test this out by passing different options to `determine_winner()` and seeing what gets printed:

```python
>>> determine_winner(Action.Rock, Action.Scissors)
Rock smashes scissors! You win!
```

Since you’re creating an action from a number, what would happen if your user tried to create an action from `3`? Remember, largest number you’ve defined so far is `2`:

```python
>>> Action(3)
ValueError: 3 is not a valid Action
```

Whoops! You don’t want that to happen. It makes sense to include the check immediately after the user has made their choice:

If the user enters an invalid value, then you repeat the step for getting the user’s choice. The only real requirement for the user selection is that it’s between `0` and `2`, inclusive. If the user’s input is outside this range, then a `ValueError` exception will be raised. To avoid displaying the default error message to the user, you can **handle** the exception.

Now that you’ve defined a few functions that reflect the steps in your flowchart, your game logic is a lot more organized and compact. This is all your `while` loop needs to contain now:

```python
while True:
    try:
        user_action = get_user_selection()
    except ValueError as e:
        range_str = f"[0, {len(Action) - 1}]"
        print(f"Invalid selection. Enter a value in range {range_str}")
        continue

    computer_action = get_computer_selection()
    determine_winner(user_action, computer_action)

    play_again = input("Play again? (y/n): ")
    if play_again.lower() != "y":
        break
```

Doesn’t that look a lot cleaner? Notice how if the user fails to select a valid range, then you use `continue` rather than `break`. This makes the code continue to the next iteration of the loop rather than break out of it.
