If you want to stay up-to-date as a developer, you need to immerse yourself in the coding culture. The programming field is so vast, and there is so much information to absorb that you’ll never get on top if you don’t keep involved enough in all the news and updates.

This article mainly focuses on bringing out the critical blog resources across the internet that deliver the top articles for programmers. With no further delay, we’d like to walk you through our curated list of the best developer blogs.

Please keep in mind that, this is not a top 10 list but a list of 10 blogs that I follow every day, to keep myself up with the constantly changing world of web development, and programming.  

## The Daily WTF - [thedailywtf.com](https://thedailywtf.com/)

Well, technically this is different from your how-to guide for developing good software, but rather a collection of stories of disastrous development, from project management going spectacularly bad to inexplicable coding choices. 

Some articles on the website are written by contributors who share their own experiences and frustrations with coding, while others are fictional stories designed to poke fun at common industry practices and stereotypes.

While the website may not be appropriate for all audiences, it does provide a lighthearted look at the challenges and absurdities of software development to me personally. 

The storytelling will keep you hooked and you will learn “what not to do” in a humorous & engaging manner.

## Substack Newsletters

Again this one is not specifically a blog but its one of my personal favourite platforms to read content. 

Substack — allows writers to send digital newsletters directly to their readers and monetize their work by putting it behind a paywall. One of the benefits of such a mechanism, for us readers is that due to this paywall, most of the writers produce quality work - why? because only good content sells. 

Here are my favourite newsletters on substack that you could give a try(Your mileage may vary):

- ByteByteGo - [https://blog.bytebytego.com/](https://blog.bytebytego.com/) - My go-to system design learning resource
- The Pragmatic Enigneer - [https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/) - Talks about big tech and high-growth startups, from inside
- Not Boring by Packy McCormick - [https://www.notboring.co/](https://www.notboring.co/) - Talks about tech, web3, optimism and strategy but not in a boring way
- Software Design, Tidy First - [https://tidyfirst.substack.com/](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/) - Book-scoped topics as articles.

## HackerNoon - [hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/)

Hacker Noon has a very wide range of activities. It is a portal that tackles issues related to technology, software development, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology. You can find mostly technical articles that provide really interesting insights.

This platform is quite popular among technical specialists and tech fans, as it is an independent resource dedicated to sharing any kind of technology news stories and expert opinions. I have been publishing on [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/simplifiedweb) recently, and it's good for both content creators and readers - 55% of their articles are rejected if they don’t match their quality assurance.

## David Walsh's Blog - [davidwalsh.name](https://davidwalsh.name/)

It is of the most well-known personal blogs run by a single developer. He is a senior web developer and front-end engineer, providing Internet users with the coolest programming tutorials. 

If you’re in search of tutorials to improve your coding and web development skills, this blog is the best place to start with. The great thing about using this blog is that you will see real examples of the programming world. You can also find free trial versions of the software in his blog.

## [CodingHorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/)

This blog is heartily enjoyed by a lot of readers. This blog is included in this list since it’s a frank, humorous blog that discusses the challenges and ironies of software creation, its ecosystem, and how it interacts (or doesn’t) with the business world.

Since 2004, it has been around us. The blog is written by Jeff Atwood, the creator of Stack Overflow. Jeff has a brilliant way of looking at coding, and he can give you a stimulating view of the tech world when you need some inspiration.

## [TestDriven.io](https://TestDriven.io)

Blog backed up by Michael Hermon - The Co-Founder/Author of [realpython.com](http://realpython.com). As the name suggests his tutorials on test-driven development, django and python are unmatched. He is popular among the Django community for being one of the early adopters of Django, and a source of inspiration for bloggers like me. 

## [Mozilla Developer Network Blogs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

The Mozilla Developer Network Blog is a programming blog that covers topics such as web development, browser technology, and JavaScript. The blog is written by a team of experts who provide valuable insights into the latest trends and updates in web development. The blog also features tutorials and resources to help programmers improve their skills.

## [Dan McKinley’s Blog](https://mcfunley.com/)

A lot of great material on how engineering companies should be run. He has a lot of ideas that sound like common sense, e.g., [choose boring technology](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology), and [ship small diffs](https://blog.skyliner.io/ship-small-diffs-741308bec0d1?gi=9b622ffaf39f) until you realize that it's actually uncommon to find opinions that are so sensible.

Mostly distilled wisdom (as opposed to, say, detailed explanations of code).

## [Janet Davis’ Blog](http://blogs.whitman.edu/countingfromzero/)

Another “not a blog”. Damn it. Yes its not a blog but an interesting story read on how a professor moved from Grinnel to Whitman and [started a CS program from scratch](http://blogs.whitman.edu/countingfromzero/2015/07/22/how-i-got-here/). The archives are great reading if you're interested in how organizations form or CS education

## [Jaana Dogan’s Blog](https://rakyll.org/)

[rakyll.org](https://rakyll.org/) has posts on Go, some of which are quite in-depth, e.g., [this set of notes on the Go generics proposal](https://rakyll.org/generics-proposal/) and [Jaana's medium blog](https://medium.com/@rakyll) has some posts on Go as well as posts on various topics in distributed systems.

Also, [Jaana's Twitter](https://twitter.com/rakyll) has what I think of as "intellectually honest critiques of the industry", which I think is unusual for critiques of the industry on Twitter. It's more typical to see people scoring points at the expense of nuance or even being vaguely in the vicinity of correctness, which is
 why I think it's worth calling out these honest critiques.
