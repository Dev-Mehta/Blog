But let's not get ahead of ourselves, first things first, let's master the basics. So grab your lab coat and let's get started on this exciting journey together!

## Step 1: Learning a Language

The first step to start learning machine learning is to pick up a programming language. There are different programming languages in the market, but the most suitable for machine learning are Python and R.

I recommend Python. Why? Because its popular, easy to learn and future-ready

With Python, you can switch domains easily. Python offers popular frameworks like Django and Flask for backend development, Tkinter for GUI development, Pygames for Game development, etc.

If you go with Python, you must learn sklearn for Machine Learning. Sklearn is a modern machine learning library written in Python. 

The best thing about sklearn is that most of the Machine learning algorithms are written for you already. It has a lot of useful classes for preprocessing your data for further analysis.

> TLDR: Pick up a Programming Language(which helps in ML ofcourse), and get familiar with it.I recommend Python along with its packages like Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, and Matplotlib. 

## Step 2 : Learn Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of vectors and matrices, and their properties and applications. It is a fundamental mathematical tool used in Machine Learning, computer graphics, physics, and engineering. To learn Linear Algebra, it is essential to understand the concepts of vectors, matrices, and their operations such as dot product, cross product, and matrix multiplication.

A good way to start is by taking an introductory course on Linear Algebra and practice solving problems related to vectors and matrices. Additionally, familiarizing yourself with software such as Matlab or Python libraries such as numpy, which have linear algebra functions built-in, can be useful in understanding the concepts and applying them in real-world scenarios. As you progress, you can delve deeper into more advanced topics such as Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, and the applications of Linear Algebra in Machine Learning.

I however do not recommend to study entire mathematical textbooks on linear algebra, as you won't need most of it while starting out, and you can easily forget the need of it, when you actually arrive to a problem when you need it.

> TLDR: Study the basics of Linear Algebra, and learn advanced topics later while learning about different ML Algorithms.

## Step 3: Learn Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It plays a crucial role in Machine Learning, as it provides the foundation for understanding probability and the underlying assumptions of many Machine Learning algorithms. 

To learn statistics, it is important to understand basic concepts such as probability distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, and correlation. A good way to start is by taking an introductory course on statistics and practicing solving problems related to probability and statistical analysis. 

As you progress, you can delve deeper into more advanced topics such as Bayesian statistics, statistical inference, and the applications of statistics in Machine Learning.

> TLDR: Learn statistics, for exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering,(basically fine-tuning your ML Model to its best possible version).

## Step 4: Learn ML Algorithms

Machine Learning algorithms are the building blocks of Machine Learning models. They are a set of mathematical and computational techniques used to train and test models that can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 

To learn Machine Learning algorithms, it is important to understand the concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. A good way to start is by familiarizing yourself with popular algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and k-means. Additionally, you can practice implementing these algorithms using popular Machine Learning frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. 

As you progress, you can delve deeper into more advanced algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and deep learning. It's also important to understand the concepts of underfitting, overfitting, and regularization, which are essential in fine-tuning the model to make accurate predictions.

In order to get an idea of how these Machine learning algorithms work from within, look into:
- Gradient Descent
- Slope
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Basic Linear Regression
- Working of all such similar models
- Clustering

An amazing resource to learn about all this is a book called ["Hands-on ML with Scikit learn and tensorflow"](https://www.amazon.in/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-Tensor/dp/9352139054/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZIGJ7RDJBZYA&dchild=1&keywords=hands+on+ml+with+scikit+learn%2C+keras+and+tensorflow&qid=1611033246&sprefix=hands+on+ml%2Ccomputers%2C305&sr=8-1)(not an affiliate link)

## Step 5 : Develop End to End Projects

Developing end-to-end projects is crucial in the field of Machine Learning as it allows you to apply the concepts and algorithms you have learned in a real-world scenario. 

It helps you to understand the entire process of a Machine Learning project, from data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, to model deployment and maintenance. 

Working on end-to-end projects also gives you the opportunity to understand the limitations and challenges of the algorithms and how to overcome them. 

Additionally, it helps you to develop problem-solving skills, as you have to take into account the requirements, constraints and goals of the project. It also allows you to have a better understanding of the business problem you are trying to solve and make predictions or decisions that are more accurate and useful. 

> TLDR: Don't end up memorizing all of stuff, while you don't use it in real life. Develop more & more projects to brush up your core concepts and get practical experience.

## Conclusion

And there you have it folks, the ultimate roadmap to Machine Learning mastery! Now that you're armed with all the knowledge and tools you need, it's time to put your skills to the test and create some mind-blowing models that'll leave your peers scratching their heads in amazement. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty and experiment with different algorithms and techniques. 

And who knows, you might just discover the next breakthrough in the field of Machine Learning. So go forth, dear reader, and make the world a smarter place one model at a time! And remember, don't forget to have some fun along the way, because let's face it, Machine Learning can get pretty boring if you don't spice it up with a little bit of humor.
