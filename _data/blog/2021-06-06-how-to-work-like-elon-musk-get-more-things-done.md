It doesn't matter what you do, where you work, or what job you are into - everyone is looking for ways to be more productive in their life. But an excessive amount of caffeine and to-do lists want to make you more productive. But before deep diving into how to get things done like a pro, you may think about what is productivity and why people these days are so obsessed with it.

A couple of days before I ran a QnA on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/zeroday.in) about what's the next topic you people would like to learn about and most of my followers wanted to learn how to be productive. So what the heck productivity is actually and why people are so much obsessed with being productive?

Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of a person completing a task within some finite amount of time. In simpler words, it would be getting more things done in less time than you do on a regular basis. But being productive does not mean that you aspire to complete more tasks in less time. Instead, you focus on fewer things and do them well.

Now you may think why the hell people these days are so obsessed with getting more productive. Maybe because in this digital era, staying focused on your work and not getting distracted is harder to accomplish than your actual task.

You can put more room to productivity in your daily workflow by following these tips

## 1. Reduce your to-do list by 50%

Getting things done during your working hours shouldn't mean fitting in doing as much as possible in the sanctioned time. Think before you make a to-do list: Do I really need to complete those 30 tasks. Take a less-in more-out approach to your to-do list by only focusing on things that matter. 

Or if you can't maintain a regular to-do list as I do. (Yes bro we are both the same). Copy the styles of the former #1 Billionaire Jeff Bezos - Make a mind map of the 3 most important goals you need to accomplish today and work hard on accomplishing them. Good luck with making a schedule for your day.

## 2. Take more Breaks(and get back to work tooüòÑ)

The ache in your brain(or back if you are a programmer) after working for several long hours is really not worth it. Since your brain has lost some of its cells by working for long hours. Give yourself a moment to refresh yourself. You'll come back recharged and ready to achieve greater goals

## 3. Follow the 80-20 rule.

Only 20 percent of what you do each day is responsible for 80 percent of your results. Eliminate the things that don't matter during your workday ‚Äî they have a minimal effect on your overall efficiency. 

## 4. Do the most important tasks first

The theory behind Most Important Tasks is that any given to-do list has some tasks that are more important than others. If you focus on simply checking off to-do list items, you‚Äôll end up with a mix of important and less important tasks completed.

It also exposes you to the potential for procrastination ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to spend the whole day checking off easy, less important to-dos instead of buckling down on the hard stuff.

Instead, spend a few minutes at the beginning of your day to choose 1‚Äì3 MITs ‚Äî the things that, no matter what, you need to finish by the end of the day.

## 5. Use your mornings to focus on yourself

Be honest with me. How many times you wake up and check WhatsApp or Instagram notifications as soon as you wake up. Perhaps every day. Focusing on yourself during the mornings is a big productivity booster. You can get way more productive by just working out a bit or meditating or even watering the plants if it makes you happy. Doing these things boost the dopamine levels that can help you be more productive throughout your day.

## 6. Stop multi-tasking.

Stop trying to do 10 things at once! Changing tasks more than 10 times a day drops your IQ an average of 10 points. Get things done more effectively and efficiently by focusing on one task at a time.

## 7. Sharpen the axe

There is a famous quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln goes like this:

> ‚ÄúGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.‚Äù

Multi-billionaire like Warren Buffet attribute much of their success to reading. It doesn't matter whether you are a student, engineer, doctor, scientist, artist. Take any profession, if you want to survive in the industry, you need to keep yourselves updated ‚Äî always. 

By spending a lot of time reading, becoming more knowledgeable, and getting better at their trade, you can make faster and more accurate decisions.

## Conclusion

These were some of the habits or patterns you will see commonly in every successful person. You won't find a billionaire who is lazy or procrastinates their work. If you need to be more productive these are the habits that you will need to follow - period. Here I haven't talked about any productivity app or website as for me - Getting the task done is more important than spending most of the time planning it out.

At this time, I have published a blog on a general topic ‚Äî of being productive. I would like to let you know that I create tutorials / blogs that might get you started with your journey with programming or help you make a better programmer.

That's all for this post. See you in the next post, until than Happy Coding.
