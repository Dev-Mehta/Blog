Are you a Django ninja who's feeling a little rusty on the details? Or a newbie just trying to navigate the complex world of web development? Well, we've got you covered with the ultimate Django cheatsheet!

First up, let's start with some basic commands. Want to create a new project? Just type `django-admin startproject projectname` into the command line. Want to start the development server? `python manage.py runserver` is your new best friend.

But what about when things get a little more complex? Fear not, because we've got you covered with some handy tips and tricks.

- Want to create a new app within your project? `python manage.py startapp appname` is all you need.
- Need to create a new database table? Use `python manage.py makemigrations appname` to create the initial migration, and then `python manage.py migrate` to actually apply the changes.
- Want to add a new field to an existing table? Use `python manage.py makemigrations appname` again, and then `python manage.py migrate` as before.
- Need to create a new superuser? `python manage.py createsuperuser` will prompt you for a username, email, and password.

And those are just the basics! With the ultimate Django cheatsheet by your side, you'll be able to tackle even the most complex projects with ease. So don't be afraid to get your hands dirty and dive into the world of web development. Because with Django, the possibilities are endless.

So, don't be afraid to use this cheatsheet like a pro and remember, even the most experienced Ninjas needs a little help sometimes.

## Defining Django Models

Here's an example of a Django model for a `Ninja` class in the style of the popular anime/manga series Naruto:

```python
from django.db import models

class Ninja(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    village = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    jutsu = models.TextField()
    chakra = models.IntegerField()
    registered_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    sharingan = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    team = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    picture = models.ImageField(upload_to='ninja_images', blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

This model defines a `Ninja` class that inherits from `models.Model`. It has several fields: `name`, `village`, `jutsu`, `chakra`, `registered_date`, `sharingan`, `team`, and `picture`.

The `name` and `village` fields are both `CharField`s, with a maximum length of 255 characters. The `jutsu` field is a `TextField`, which can store longer pieces of text, and `chakra` is an `IntegerField` representing the amount of chakra a ninja has.

The `registered_date` field is a `DateTimeField` with `auto_now_add=True` this means that it will automatically be set to the current date and time when a new `Ninja` is created.

The `sharingan` field is a `BooleanField` which can be used to represent whether the ninja has the Sharingan or not, with a default value of False.

The `team` field is a `CharField` with a maximum length of 255 characters, and is optional(`blank=True, null=True`) since not all ninjas are part of a team.

Finally, the `picture` field is an `ImageField` that will handle the upload of an image of the ninja and store it in the 'ninja_images' directory.

## Defining views

Here's an example of a `views.py` file for a Django application in the style of the popular anime/manga series Naruto:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Ninja

def index(request):
    all_ninjas = Ninja.objects.all()
    context = {'all_ninjas': all_ninjas}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/index.html', context)

def ninja_detail(request, ninja_id):
    ninja = Ninja.objects.get(pk=ninja_id)
    context = {'ninja': ninja}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/ninja_detail.html', context)

def team(request, team_name):
    team_members = Ninja.objects.filter(team__iexact=team_name)
    context = {'team_members': team_members, 'team_name': team_name}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/team.html', context)

def search(request):
    query = request.GET.get('q')
    search_results = Ninja.objects.filter(name__icontains=query)
    context = {'search_results': search_results, 'query': query}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/search.html', context)
```

This `views.py` file contains several functions that handle different pages of the application:

- The `index` function retrieves all the `Ninja` objects from the database using the `Ninja.objects.all()` method and stores them in the context dictionary. Then it renders the `index.html` template and passes the context to it.
- The `ninja_detail` function retrieves a specific `Ninja` object from the database using the `Ninja.objects.get(pk=ninja_id)` method and stores it in the context dictionary. Then it renders the `ninja_detail.html` template and passes the context to it.
- The `team` function retrieves all the `Ninja` objects that belong to a specific team using the `Ninja.objects.filter(team__iexact=team_name)` method and stores them in the context dictionary. Then it renders the `team.html` template and passes the context to it.
- The `search` function retrieves all the `Ninja` objects whose name contains a specific query using the `Ninja.objects.filter(name__icontains=query)` method and stores them in the context dictionary. Then it renders the `search.html` template and passes the context to it.

It's important to notice that this is just an example, and you may need to adapt this views to your specific use case and also to add the URL routing for these views.

## Connecting Views to URL Endpoints

Here’s an example of how to connect the views we have defined to their endpoints

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('ninja/<int:ninja_id>/', views.ninja_detail, name='ninja_detail'),
    path('team/<str:team_name>/', views.team, name='team'),
    path('search/', views.search, name='search'),
]
```

This `urls.py` file maps URLs to the corresponding views in the `views.py` file:

- The empty string `''` maps to the `index` view.
- The string `'ninja/<int:ninja_id>/'` maps to the `ninja_detail` view, and includes a variable `ninja_id` that is passed to the view as an argument.
- The string `'team/<str:team_name>/'` maps to the `team` view, and includes a variable `team_name` that is passed to the view as an argument.
- The string `'search/'` maps to the `search` view.

You can also notice that each path has a name, this names can be used in the template to generate URLs. Also, it's important to include this urls.py file in the main urls.py file of your project with the `include` function.

## Rendering HTML Responses for above views

**index.html**

```html
<h1>Welcome to the Ninja Database</h1>
<ul>
{% for ninja in all_ninjas %}
    <li><a href="{% url 'ninja_detail' ninja.id %}">{{ ninja.name }}</a> from {{ ninja.village }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

This template displays a heading and an unordered list of all the ninjas in the database. Each list item contains a link to the `ninja_detail` view for that specific ninja, using the `{% url %}` template tag to generate the URL and passing the `ninja.id` as the `ninja_id` argument.

**ninja_detail.html**

```html
<h1>{{ ninja.name }}</h1>
<p>Village: {{ ninja.village }}</p>
<p>Jutsu: {{ ninja.jutsu }}</p>
<p>Chakra: {{ ninja.chakra }}</p>
<p>Has Sharingan: {% if ninja.sharingan %}yes{% else %}no{% endif %}</p>
<p>Team: {% if ninja.team %}{{ ninja.team }}{% else %}none{% endif %}</p>
{% if ninja.picture %}
    <img src="{{ ninja.picture.url }}" alt="{{ ninja.name }}">
{% endif %}

```

This template displays the details of a single ninja, including name, village, jutsu, chakra, Sharingan,etc.

## Function Based Views

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from .models import Ninja

def index(request):
    all_ninjas = Ninja.objects.all()
    context = {'all_ninjas': all_ninjas}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/index.html', context)

def ninja_detail(request, ninja_id):
    ninja = get_object_or_404(Ninja, pk=ninja_id)
    context = {'ninja': ninja}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/ninja_detail.html', context)

def team(request, team_name):
    team_members = Ninja.objects.filter(team__iexact=team_name)
    context = {'team_members': team_members, 'team_name': team_name}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/team.html', context)

def search(request):
    query = request.GET.get('q')
    search_results = Ninja.objects.filter(name__icontains=query)
    context = {'search_results': search_results, 'query': query}
    return render(request, 'ninjas/search.html', context)
```

This is similar to the previous example, the main difference is the use of get_object_or_404 function in ninja_detail view to handle cases when the ninja_id passed in the URL is not found.

It's important to notice that this is just an example, and you may need 
to adapt this views to your specific use case and also to add the URL 
routing for these views.

## Class Based Views

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView
from .models import Ninja

class NinjaListView(ListView):
    model = Ninja
    template_name = 'ninjas/index.html'
    context_object_name = 'all_ninjas'

class NinjaDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Ninja
    template_name = 'ninjas/ninja_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'ninja'

class TeamView(ListView):
    template_name = 'ninjas/team.html'
    context_object_name = 'team_members'

    def get_queryset(self):
        return Ninja.objects.filter(team__iexact=self.kwargs['team_name'])

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['team_name'] = self.kwargs['team_name']
        return context

class SearchView(ListView):
    template_name = 'ninjas/search.html'
    context_object_name = 'search_results'

    def get_queryset(self):
        query = self.request.GET.get('q')
        return Ninja.objects.filter(name__icontains=query)

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['query'] = self.request.GET.get('q')
        return context
```

This is similar to the function-based views example, but it uses Django's built-in class-based views to handle the common logic of displaying lists and details of objects. The `ListView` and `DetailView` classes are generic views that handle fetching and paginating the objects from the database, and rendering the template.

It's important to notice that `TeamView` and `SearchView` are subclasses of `ListView` and they implement the methods `get_queryset` and `get_context_data` to handle the specific logic of displaying a team members and search results.
It's important also to notice that this is just an example, and you may need to adapt this views to your specific use case and also to add the URL routing for these views.

## Forms

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Ninja

class NinjaForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Ninja
        fields = ['name', 'village', 'jutsu', 'chakra', 'sharingan', 'team', 'picture']

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['jutsu'].widget.attrs.update({'class': 'jutsu-selector'})
        self.fields['team'].widget.attrs.update({'class': 'team-selector'})
        self.fields['picture'].widget.attrs.update({'class': 'picture-input'})

class SearchForm(forms.Form):
    query = forms.CharField(label='Search for a ninja', max_length=100)
    team = forms.ChoiceField(choices=[('', 'All teams'), ('Team 7', 'Team 7'), ('Team 8', 'Team 8'), ('Team 10', 'Team 10'), ('Akatsuki', 'Akatsuki')], required=False)
```

This is an example of how to create a form to manage the data of a Ninja model. The `NinjaForm` class is a `ModelForm` that is created using the Ninja model and the fields specified in the `fields` attribute.

The `__init__` method is overriden to add classes to the widgets of the form fields, for example `jutsu-selector` to jutsu field, `team-selector` to team field and `picture-input` to picture field.

The `SearchForm` class is a regular `Form` class, it's created using the `CharField` and `ChoiceField` form fields. The `query` field is used to search for a ninja by name, and the `team`
 field is used to filter the search results by team. 

The `choices` attribute of the `ChoiceField` is used to specify the available teams to filter by, and the `required=False` attribute is used to make the field optional, so the user can search for ninjas without filtering by team.

## Django Apps

```bash
python manage.py startapp uchiha-clan
```

This command will create a new directory called "uchiha-clan" in your project's root directory. This directory will contain the necessary files and directories for a Django app, such as `models.py`, `views.py`, `urls.py`, `migrations/` and `admin.py`.

You can then use the files in this directory to define your models, views, URLs, and other components of your app related to uchiha clan.

It's important to notice that after creating the app, you should make sure to add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `settings.py` file of your project so that Django knows about the new app and can use it.

## Adding an app to settings.py

### Database Configuration

```bash
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### Timezone Configuration

```bash
TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'
```

### Application Configuration

```bash
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'app1',
    'app2',
    'app3',
]
```

### Middleware Configuration

```bash
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]
```

### Allowed Hosts

The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting is used to specify a list of hostnames that this Django site can serve. This is a security measure to prevent an attacker from poisoning caches and password reset emails with links to malicious hosts by submitting requests with a fake HTTP Host header, which is possible even under many seemingly-safe webserver configurations.

```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com', 'www.example.com']
```

### Static files

In production, you will also want to serve your static files using a separate web server, such as Apache or Nginx, rather than using the built-in Django development server. You'll need to configure your web server to serve the files in the `STATIC_ROOT` directory.

Here's an exa

mple of how you might set `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATIC_URL` in your `settings.py` file:

```python
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
```

In addition, you might want to configure your web server to serve media files as well.
