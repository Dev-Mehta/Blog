			<h1>Welcome to SimplifiedWeb,</h1>
			<p>
				Hello there! My name is Dev, and I am a Full Stack Django Web Developer and Part-time Blogger. 
			<p/>
			<p>
				I have a deep love for coding that started with my first "Hello World" script in Python. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies, and I am always eager to share my knowledge with others.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have expertise in Django and Java, and I use these skills to develop web and mobile applications that are both functional and user-friendly. As a Full Stack Django Web Developer, I have the ability to work on both the front-end and back-end of web applications, making me a valuable asset in the tech industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to my passion for coding, I am also a part-time blogger. I love to share my experiences and knowledge with others, and I believe that by sharing my skills, I can help others grow in their careers and learn from my expertise.
			</p>
			<p>
				Stay tuned for my latest updates, tutorials, and insights into the world of web development. I am excited to share my journey with you and to help you grow in your own career.
